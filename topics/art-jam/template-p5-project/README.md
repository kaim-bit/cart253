## Description

This is a weird self portrait of me, the main functions are the moving clock that gets faster over time and maxes out at a certain speed, the cursor can pick up the shirt and expose the ribcage, and the preloaded image hair

## New Functions

i have never used Function Preload() or image(), i used them for the really weird hair. I also used Cursor()
