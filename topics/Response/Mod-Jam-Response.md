I was very excited to dive into the modjams of the people under my name. I will talk about each one and what I liked and how it was achieved as well as the overall game experience.


Lanna Check.

This is by far my favorite out of the three that I will cover. The game is a “survive as long as you can” type of game and it is a super clean design. I was blown away by the rules section. She included animated imaging, interactive text, and a whole example game to see it work. And the art is very clean. Then comes the game itself. I like the flies, the random sizing and wave speed. I would only say that maybe too much was going on. The coding is amazing, I was personally afraid to attempt timers, but I am happy to see someone conquer it. Also the event handling to where you can walk through the tutorial at your own speed, super awesome stuff and also very motivational. Lanna check is like the david goggins of cart 253.

This was a very cool one, the goal is to eat flies until the night, and to avoid the fireflies that kill you. I loved the starting condition where you literally have to type FROG to start the game, or so you think! I looked into the code to see this amazing use of if statements and conditions and all i saw was a FRAUD. You only have to type in the letter “g” to start the game, this is a really smart way to do it though because i never doubted it for a second until I unveiled the mask. I imagine she was laughing as she made this. Either way a super awesome game. The only thing I will say is she had some tongue register issues to where it would double hit a firefly. But this probably is how the tongue normally is, i made the tongue different in my game so it couldn't behave like this.

This game was unique in its goal, to get as high of a score as possible. I didn't see this basically anywhere in the walk around testing, i guess you can say mine has it but either way cool idea. I don't feel like I have much to say, I like the fly code and how it changes the fly's movement. I wish there were some tunes or sound effects but hey atleast the game has no bugs.

In conclusion, all of these games were cool to play. I am super impressed with Lanna’s mod jam and what she did with it. I love to see the work of people that I don't interact with in the class. It's very cool to see such talented people you haven't even heard of before. But all three of these projects share some personal spirit of their creators and are unique in their own way. I am excited to see what's in store for this variation jam.
